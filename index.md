Ouroboros is a reflex-based, peer-to-peer game that runs in the browser, modeled off of the game Snake.  Ouroboros utilizes a conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) to ensure consistency of game state among peers.  Connections are established with WebRTC, a native browser technology for forming peer-to-peer connections.
