# About Me
<section class="about">
  <p>I am a full-stack software engineer with a background in biology, and have found significant overlap between application development and my prior experience with scientific research and experimental design. The ability to think critically and avoid assumptions helps me write web applications that emphasize ease-of-use and scalability, reflecting a performant, well-tested, and maintainable codebase.</p>

    <p>Ouroboros is a reflex-based, peer-to-peer game that runs in the browser, modeled off of the game Snake.  Ouroboros     utilizes a conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) to ensure consistency of game state among peers.  Connections are established with WebRTC, a native browser technology for forming peer-to-peer connections.</p>
